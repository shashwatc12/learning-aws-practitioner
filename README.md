  > Somebody once told me: keep learning no matter what :) 

  > I was studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam. Here is my study path that I designed and followed to pass the exam :)


## Recommendations
```
Some recommendations that worked for me:
  - I took notes of acronyms meaning and names of services. In most cases, these names have a relation with the objective of the service. So using my background and logic I solved some questions!
  - I took notes of little details that I considered important or hard to remember. In this way, when I was learning, I could go back and I had a chance to remember the notes with just a quick look.
  - I read the requirements, rules, times, numbers of questions related to the exam! I didn't want to lose the exam for not being on time.
  - I completed the course - AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials. It is free and it just takes 6 hours.
  - I tried some AWS Cloud practitioner sample questions.
  - I read about the pricing model, conditions of service support and the available regions.
  - I tried the simulation tests in [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) or [O'reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) They are paid, but free trial versions work well.
  - I attended the online exam, so I chose my home with the supervision of a remote person.
  - Finally, I tried to sleep well the previous day and after the exam, I enjoyed a bar of chocolate!  If you don't pass the exam, there is always a solution. Although you have to pay again, it is not game over!

 Consider following this roadmap and mark each step when you finish :smile:
